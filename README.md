Automaker is an autonomous AI development studio that transforms how you build software. Instead of manually writing every line of code, you describe features on a Kanban board and watch as AI agents powered by Claude Code automatically implement them.

## What Makes Automaker Different?

Traditional development tools help you write code. Automaker helps you **orchestrate AI agents** to build entire features autonomously. Think of it as having a team of AI developers working for you—you define what needs to be built, and Automaker handles the implementation.

### The Workflow

1. **Add Features** - Describe features you want built (with text, images, or screenshots)
2. **Move to "In Progress"** - Automaker automatically assigns an AI agent to implement the feature
3. **Watch It Build** - See real-time progress as the agent writes code, runs tests, and makes changes
4. **Review & Verify** - Review the changes, run tests, and approve when ready
5. **Ship Faster** - Build entire applications in days, not weeks

### Powered by Claude Code

Automaker leverages the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to give AI agents full access to your codebase. Agents can read files, write code, execute commands, run tests, and make git commits—all while working in isolated git worktrees to keep your main branch safe.

### Why This Matters

The future of software development is **agentic coding**—where developers become architects directing AI agents rather than manual coders. Automaker puts this future in your hands today, letting you experience what it's like to build software 10x faster with AI agents handling the implementation while you focus on architecture and business logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AutoMaker-Org/automaker.git
cd automaker

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run Automaker (pick your mode)
npm run dev
# Then choose your run mode when prompted, or use specific commands below
```

## How to Run

### Development Mode

Start Automaker in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will prompt you to choose your run mode, or you can specify a mode directly:

#### Electron Desktop App (Recommended)

```bash
# Standard development mode
npm run dev:electron

# With DevTools open automatically
npm run dev:electron:debug

# For WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
npm run dev:electron:wsl

# For WSL with GPU acceleration
npm run dev:electron:wsl:gpu
```

#### Web Browser Mode

```bash
# Run in web browser (http://localhost:3007)
npm run dev:web
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build Next.js app
npm run build

# Build Electron app for distribution
npm run build:electron
```

### Running Production Build

```bash
# Start production Next.js server
npm run start
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests headless
npm run test

# Run tests with browser visible
npm run test:headed
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint
```

### Authentication Options

Automaker supports multiple authentication methods (in order of priority):

| Method           | Environment Variable | Description                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API Key (env)    | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`  | Anthropic API key               |
| API Key (stored) | —                    | Anthropic API key stored in app |

### Persistent Setup (Optional)

Add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.
